##Scenario:
#You are playing a game on your personal computer

#You are on a level in the game that requires you to solve a riddle

#On this level the riddle you need to solve is that you need to create a machine that can read symbols

#The symbols you are given are the following: symbol_list = {'>': '<', '\': '/', ')': '('}

#These symbols are included in a stack

##Problem Statement (Valid Parenthesis):
#Given a string s containing just the characters '>', '<', '\', '/', ')' and '(', determine if the input string is valid.

#An input string is valid if:

#Open symbols must be closed by the same type of brackets.
#Open symbols must be closed in the correct order.
#Every closing symbol has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
