#Scenario:
#You are on a quest to uncover the ultimate secret of the universe. Just as you get close to your goal, you encounter a 
#mysterious door. Above the door, a cryptic number—19—is engraved. The door itself bears four numbers: [3, 4, 15, 18]. 
#Your challenge is to use these numbers to unlock the door and reveal the secret within.

#Problem Statement (Two-Sum):
#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target. 
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. 
#You can return the answer in any order.
